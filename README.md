# Look then Leap Algorithm
This is a python script that simulates the look then leap method when making a selection. Selecting the best roomate is the use case for this script

The theory behind this method is that, when wanting to identify an optimal selection one must first survey a set, then make a selection that fulfills the criteria after the initial set.

This algorithm determined that surveying 33% of the total number of roomates before making a definitive choice yielded the best odds to select the best roomate.
